		<p>The theoretical ways of handling business are much different from the practical ways of handling it.</p><br/>
		<p>Once you start up a business, you will very soon discover the differences of the real business world and the textbook way.</p><br/>
		<p>The practical issues like invoices, sales, profits, payments, tax, suppliers, customers, checks may create some amount of problems.</p><br/>
		<p>Invoices don't get paid by their due dates, ads don't consistently bring in customers, sales don't continually rise, and profits aren't always there.</p>
